I'm Zhe (pronounced like "_Juh_"), currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Berkeley and University of Ghana, working on the [Retail Finance Distribution (ReFinD)][https://refind-isser.ug.edu.gh/] research initiative. I graduated from the University of Washington in 2023 with a Ph.D. in Economics. Before graduate school, I worked as a Research Analyst at the IMF. 

My research interests lie in development and labor economics, with a specific focus on exploring the impact of digital connectivity on labor and retail finance markets in developing countries.
